    <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">I am a full stacked software developer from Hong Kong and based in London, UK. I
      enjoy writing codes and building side projets in my own time among other hobbies. It means a lot to me that I get
      to enjoy what we are doing at work, be passionate about learning new skills and improving ourselves, but most
      importantly be excited and proud of our products. This is how we can get off our bed every morning and start our
      day with energy and dedication. That is probably why I decided to work in the TV media industry and later the
      entertainment industry. Yes there are challenges and difficult times just like many other things in life, but on
      the weekends lying on my favourite yoga mat, I do feel satisfied and grateful as I know I have learnt a few things
      and have spent my time to work on something meaningful. Later at night there is no better sleep than that.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-light mt-4">On a few occasions I was forunate enough to have a the opportunities to travel to
      Singapore and Spain for work. Not only have I picked up Angular 2 and learnt a lot more about the business
      operation on the other side of the company, I have also made a few great friends in the trip and have some amazing
      experiences with different cultures, which I guess I really can't ask for more and makes my role as a software
      developer a lot more meaningful than just another day job. </p>

    <p class="font-weight-light mt-5">(more about myself i guess...) In my spare time apart from coding, I like to play
      music, mostly on piano and drums. Sometimes I get
      to record a
      few cover songs with friends and share with everyone on our Youtube channel. After playing in the orchestra for a
      long time since I was kid, in university I
      decided to try something a bit different. Perhaps it is because I grew up with classical music, I am always
      quietly into instrumental music even though most of my friends don't share the same interest.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">Like many software developers, I always want to achieve something. I want to have
      a product that is truly my contribution and can be proudly shared with family and friends. Quite often I face a
      common problem when starting to plan for a new project: I am excited to try out on new tech new library or simply
      a new update, but I am not always exactly sure what to do with it. So I have written a couple of demo projects
      with the likes of C# .NET Core 3.1, Angular 8 and NativeScript 6 etc in the past, but they are all demo only or
      sometimes failed collaboration and I didn't actually publish them.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">(more about the channel and the recordings, breifly) I formed a small Youtube
      channel in 2014 with a few friends from university.
      At first we were just trying to find a reason to get together and jam, but later on I was like if we want to do
      something then we should do it right. We then took more time to prepare and practice for the recording session. To
      be
      honest my dream is always to get a chance to perform live, trying to get half famous on the internet is never our
      goal and like a kid I
      just want to play music. The Youtube channel is a platform to share music with more people, and secretly
      hoping one day someone will watch it and invite us to perform live or something and that will be the best
      day ever. Of
      course that
      never happened and that's okay. We have learnt a lot in our recording session especially those things that we
      could never experienced in a 60 people orchestra. I love every single moment of it and it is easily one of the
      best thing I have done during my time in uni, given that my degree is actually aobut something totally unrelated.
      Sometimes when you are having a bad day, dragged your tired body back home and received a comment or message from
      the Youtube channel. It could be a really simple and short compliment but that reminds me of my little dream and
      keeps me going. Those are the best kinds.

      So the channel is bascially my friends and I covering some of our favourite songs in our own way. There is a bit
      of everything in it and here are some of the highlights. Hope you will like it and enjoy.
