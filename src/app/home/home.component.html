    <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">I am a full stacked software developer from Hong Kong and based in London, UK. I
      enjoy writing codes and building side projets in my own time among other hobbies. It means a lot to me that I get
      to enjoy what we are doing at work, be passionate about learning new skills and improving ourselves, but most
      importantly be excited and proud of our products. This is how we can get off our bed every morning and start our
      day with energy and dedication. That is probably why I decided to work in the TV media industry and later the
      entertainment industry. Yes there are challenges and difficult times just like many other things in life, but on
      the weekends lying on my favourite yoga mat, I do feel satisfied and grateful as I know I have learnt a few things
      and have spent my time to work on something meaningful. Later at night there is no better sleep than that.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-light mt-4">On a few occasions I was forunate enough to have a the opportunities to travel to
      Singapore and Spain for work. Not only have I picked up Angular 2 and learnt a lot more about the business
      operation on the other side of the company, I have also made a few great friends in the trip and have some amazing
      experiences with different cultures, which I guess I really can't ask for more and makes my role as a software
      developer a lot more meaningful than just another day job. </p>

    <p class="font-weight-light mt-5">Apart from coding and other technical stuff, in my spare time I like to play
      music, mostly on piano and drums. Sometimes I get
      to record a
      few cover songs with friends and share with everyone on our Youtube channel.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">Like many software developers, I always want to achieve something. I want to have
      a product that is truly my contribution and can be proudly shared with family and friends. Quite often I face a
      common problem when starting to plan for a new project: I am excited to try out on new tech new library or simply
      a new update, but I am not always exactly sure what to do with it. So I have written a couple of demo projects
      with the likes of C# .NET Core 3.1, Angular 8 and NativeScript 6 etc in the past, but they are all demo only or
      sometimes failed collaboration and I didn't actually publish them.</p>
