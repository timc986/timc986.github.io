    <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">I am a full stacked software developer from Hong Kong and based in London, UK. I
      enjoy writing codes
      and building side projets in my own time among other hobbies. To me it means a lot that I can enjoy what we are
      doing at work, get genuine interest in the industry and most importantly be excited and proud of our products,
      then
      we can get off our bed every morning and start our day with dedication and energy. That is
      probably one of the main reason of why I decided to work in a tv media company and the entertainment industry. Yes
      there are difficult times and challenges just like many other jobs, but on every weekend lying on the yoga mat, I
      do feel satisfied and grateful as I know I have learnt a few things and have spent my time to work on
      something meaningful. Later at night there is no better sleep than that.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-light mt-4">On rare occasions I did get a few chances
      to
      travel to Singapore and Spain for work, not only have I picked up Angular 2 and learnt a lot more about the
      business operation on the other side of the company, I have also made a few great friends in the trip and have
      some amazing experience with different cultures, which I guess I really can't ask for more and makes my role as a
      software developer a lot more meaningful than just another day job. </p>

    <p class="font-weight-light mt-4">In my spare time I like to play music, mainly on piano and drums. Sometimes I get
      to record a
      few cover songs with friends and share with everyone on our Youtube channel.</p>
