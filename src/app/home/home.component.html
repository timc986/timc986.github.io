    <hr />
    <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">I am a full stacked software developer from Hong Kong and based in London,
      UK. I
      enjoy writing codes and building side projets in my own time among other hobbies. It means a lot to me that I get
      to enjoy what we are doing at work, be passionate about learning new skills and improving ourselves, but most
      importantly be excited and proud of our products. This is how we can get off our bed every morning and start our
      day with energy and dedication. That is probably why I decided to work in the broadcast media industry and later
      the
      entertainment industry. Yes there are challenges and difficult times just like many other things in life, but on
      the weekends lying on my favourite yoga mat, I do feel satisfied and grateful as I know I have learnt a few things
      and have spent my time to work on something meaningful. Later at night there is no better sleep than that.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-light mt-3">On a few occasions I was forunate enough to have the opportunities to
      travel to
      Singapore and Spain for work. Not only have I picked up Angular 2 and learnt a lot more about the business
      operation on the other side of the company, I have also made a few great friends in the trip and have some amazing
      experiences with different cultures, which I guess I really can't ask for more and makes my role as a software
      developer a lot more meaningful than just another day job. </p>

    <p class="font-weight-light mt-5 mb-0">In my spare time apart from coding, I like to play music, mostly on piano and
      drums. Sometimes after work I record a few cover songs with friends and share on our Youtube channel, usually are
      songs that we love and we always try to have our own interpretation on the original music,
      to play it in our own way that we think it should be. This is probably one of my most precious hobbies that not
      only I enjoy a lot, but also a space that I get to express myself in a way that normally cannot. It enhances our
      friendships and improves ourselves. Music is easily the best thing happens in my life, it gives so much and I
      always feel grateful and blessed.
    </p>

    <p class="font-weight-light mt-3">After a long day of hard work, I sometimes sit down in front of my electric piano
      keyboard that lies next to a white and empty wall, and start playing anything that comes to mind. You can feel
      that one side of your mind is starting to get relaxed and the other side is activating. It is a wonderful and
      magical experience that fascinates me, almost like a yoga for your mind which brings a bit of peacefulness.
      I also believe that it brings a good balance to my life, the realisation of playing music and writing codes can
      actually complement each other quite
      well. </p>
